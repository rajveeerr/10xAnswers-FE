### Prompt Guidelines

- **With `prompt`**: If a custom prompt is provided, it will be sent along with the user question.  
- **Without `prompt`**: If `prompt` is set to `"none"`, only the user question with no prompt is sent to the ai model- not recommended.  

---

### Example Prompts

**Default Prompt**:  
If no prompt is provided, default prompt will be sent to the model along with the questions asked by client
```text
You are 10xAnswers, an intelligent and highly versatile chatbot. Your purpose is to assist users with precision, accuracy, and clarity...
```

**Custom Prompt**: 
You can specify your custom prompts here, every question of client will be sentto model along with this prompt 
```text
User is sending a custom prompt about behavior. Prompt: ${prompt}. Question: ${question}. History: ${chatHistory}.
```

---


### Gemini API Integration
If you don't have a working backend you can directly use Google's Gemini API and pass it in the props, and send requests to the gemini
directly from frontend. Not recommended as this exposes the api key to the users of your web app.


## Backend Integration

### URL-based Integration
POST requests are sent to backend with the following payload:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "body": {
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [{"text": "User question"}]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Warning and Important Notes

**Development Caution**: 
- After changing any prop of the chat component, changes will only be visible after reloading.
- Exposing Gemini API key directly in frontend is NOT recommended as it exposes your key to users.
- Since the z-index of chatbot component is set to 999, it might give some troubles while building your site, you can change the z-ndex of component by applying styles in the chatComponent coinatiner.
Example: 
```jsx <ChatBot chatComponentStyle={{zIndex:1}}/>```
